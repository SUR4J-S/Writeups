**Description:**  

You discover a log file hidden in a shared folder. Check its contents to see if it contains useful information


#### [WindShine_Activity_Records_2024.log](WindShine_Activity_Records_2024.log)


## Solution

The log file contains entries in a consistent format with timestamps, log levels, user actions, and IP addresses. Within this file, the flag may be hidden somewhere in the logs.

Instead of searching line by line, weâ€™ll use the grep command to search for the pattern cyberarc{, which matches the start of the flag format. This command will help us quickly locate the relevant line containing the flag.


```bash
grep cyberarc{ WindShine_Activity_Records_2024.log
```
