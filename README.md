**Step 1: Analyze the PDF Document**:  
    We are provided with a PDF file that appears to contain plans related to the printing of John Cena posters. Upon initial inspection, the document looks ordinary, with no visible flags or hints.

**Step 2: Reveal Hidden Text:**  
    The flag is cleverly hidden in the PDF, formatted in white text that matches the background color. To uncover the hidden flag, we can simply select all the text in the PDF.

**Step 3: Use Ctrl+A**:  
    By pressing **Ctrl+A** (or Command+A on macOS), we can select all the content in the document. This action will highlight the white text along with the visible content, allowing us to see the hidden flag.
