**Step 1: Listen to the Song Carefully and Analyze in Audacity**  
   Start by listening to the song "Big Dawgs." Pay special attention to the area around **3:14**. If you listen carefully, you will hear some distinct beep sounds that may hint at hidden information.  
   Using Audacity will allow you to visually analyze the audio file and potentially reveal hidden messages that may not be easily discernible by ear.

**Step 2: Download and Install Audacity**  
   If you donâ€™t have Audacity installed, download it from the official site: [Audacity Download](https://www.audacityteam.org/download/).  
   Audacity is a free, open-source, cross-platform audio software that allows users to record, edit, and analyze audio files.

3. You can adjust the settings for the spectrogram view by selecting **Spectrogram Settings...** from the same dropdown. This allows you to change parameters like the window size or range.

**Step 5: Analyze the Spectrogram**  
   - After changing to spectrogram view, navigate to the area around **3:14** in the song. 
   - Listen carefully as you observe the spectrogram; you might notice that the flag is visually represented within the wave patterns.
